  scenarioText: "At first the room seems dark and empty, when suddenly the upper
    torso of an enormous mechanical jester springs down from the ceiling. \u201CSo
    VERY bored!\u201D It sings in squeaky rusted tones. \u201CInput entertainment
    immediately!\u201D"
  passTraitText: "{0} has practically been preparing all their life for this moment.
    Years of working on their stand up skit, now they finally have an audience! {0}
    starts with the joke about the mailman, and ends with a series of elaborate mimes.
    All the while, the jester spins, laughs and claps. \u201CGood, GOOD! Yes! You
    are LITTLE Jester!\u201D The jester opens the exit door with its enormous hand.
    \u201CGo now, Little Jester!\u201D"
  secondary1PassText: "{0} suspects they may share a sense of humor with the terrifying
    jester. They launch into a tirade of pointed jokes about various topics, all
    the while the jester laughs and claps. When {0} finishes, the jester speaks.
    \u201CMOST HUMOROUS. How does it think up SUCH rubbish? Stupid creature is HILARIOUS
    to Jester.\u201D The jester opens the exit door with its enormous hand. \u201CGo
    now, stupid creature!\u201D"
  secondary2PassText: "{0} suggests they play a game together. The jester spins angrily.
    \u201CJester does NOT like games. Jester does not like LOSING.\u201D {0} sweats
    a little, but draws some three by three grids on the dusty floor, explaining
    the rules of tic-tac-toe. They spend the next few minutes desperately trying
    to lose the game to the incompetent Jester, who claps and laughs as it wins.
    \u201CJester is good at games! Yes! You are GOOD teacher!\u201D The jester opens
    the exit door with its enormous hand. \u201CGo now, good teacher!\u201D"
  luckyPassText: "{0} isn\u2019t really sure what kind of thing the giant jester
    finds entertaining. They deliver a few poorly remembered knock knock jokes, but
    the jester spins angrily. \u201CNo NO! This is NOT entertaining! I will SHOW
    you!\u201D The jester clears its throat, a few drops of engine oil trickling
    out of its mouth. \u201CWhy did the MONKEY fall out of the tree?\u201D it pauses
    for effect. \u201CBecause it was DEAD!\u201D The jester claps and laughs at its
    own joke, before opening the exit door with its enormous hand. \u201CGo now,
    silly creature.\u201D"
