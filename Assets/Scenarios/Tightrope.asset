    the edge of the ledge, they lower themself as far as they can into the pit, and
    drop. There is silence for a long minute before a ladder emerges from the shade.'

    fall into the darkness with a cry. There is a sickening crunch, and then silence

    to move it before succumbing to their injuries.'
