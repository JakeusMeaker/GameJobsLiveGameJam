  scenarioText: "Three large figures sit around a ritual circle. They speak in turn.
    \u201CAre you one of us?\u201D. \u201CYour actions matter, not your words\u201D
    \u201CShow us the darkness inside of you.\u201D The third figure places a knife
    before the circle. As they do, a goat trots out of the shadow and sits in the
    center of the circle, unusually serene."
  passTraitText: "{0} knows what they must do. Instead of using the ritual knife,
    they take out their own, looking at the figures while they do. Then they kneel
    before the goat and slit its throat. The goat slumps with barely a sound, and
    the circle glows with an eerie light. The third figure speaks again, a slow hiss.
    \u201CYes... You can do what must be done. Go forth knowing that you have been
    chosen.\u201D"
  secondary1PassText: "{0} will take no joy in it, but the figures made it clear.
    There is one solution. There\u2019s no talking through this one, no fighting
    or running away. {0} takes the knife and kneels before the goat. With a shaking
    hand, they draw the knife over the throat of the goat, which slumps with barely
    a sound. The circle glows with an eerie light, and the third figure speaks again,
    a slow hiss. \u201CYes\u2026 Pragmatism. A seed of darkness. Go forth.\u201D"
  secondary2PassText: "{0} has done things they\u2019re not proud of. Not goat killing,
    but when push comes to shove... {0} takes the knife and kneels before the goat.
    Somewhat reluctantly, they draw the knife over the throat of the goat, which
    slumps with barely a sound. The circle glows with an eerie light, and the third
    figure speaks again, a slow hiss. \u201CYes\u2026 You are on the path. Go forth.\u201D"
  luckyPassText: "Reluctantly, {0} shakes their head. They can\u2019t just kill a
    goat with a knife. In unison, the three figures whisper, \u201CYou have failed.\u201D 
    The third speaks again, this time in a hiss of pure hatred. \u201CAnd yet you
    will not pay the toll. But know this. It is the hand fortune, and only that which
    has stilled our hand this day. You may not be so lucky again. Leave now, lest
    she withdraw her protection.\u201D"
  failText: "{0} shakes their head. They can\u2019t just kill a goat with a knife. 
    The third figure speaks again, this time in a hiss that cannot disguise its glee.
    \u201CAnd so you will pay the toll. A pound of flesh, and a cup of blood.\u201D
    He takes the knife and flicks it at the chalice and scales in turn, which fill
    with a pure red liquid and a gooey pinkish lump respectively. {0} cries out in
    pain and shock as they realise what has just been taken from them. \u201CAnd
    now you may go forth.\u201D"
