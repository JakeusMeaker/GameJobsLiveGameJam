  scenarioText: "At the edge of the room sits a creature, sobbing despondently into
    its arms. It looks like a child, but horns sprout from its forehead, and a tail
    quivers against the wall. It looks up when it hears the footfalls. \u201CAre
    you here to help me?\u201D "
  passTraitText: "{0} Smiles at the child, kneeling before it and asking what\u2019s
    wrong. \u201CI can\u2019t find my pets!\u201D It sobs in response. {0} expresses
    great sympathy, and before too long, they are rocking it to sleep, singing a
    lullaby. The child drifts off with a smile on its face. "
  secondary1PassText: "{0} chuckles gently. They sit some distance from the child,
    who at first eyes them distrustfully. After a few silly jokes and a story, they
    seem to have calmed down, and {0} explains they need to keep moving. \u201CIf
    you see my pets, tell them to come back!\u201D says the child."
  secondary2PassText: "{0} Smiles at the child-creature, crouching before it and
    asking what\u2019s wrong. \u201CI can\u2019t find my pets!\u201D It sobs in response.
    {0} expresses great sympathy, and opens their arms to offer a hug. When the creature
    stumbles forward to reciprocate, {0} moves quickly, kicking out its feet, and
    pushing its face down into the floor. Not stopping to see if it\u2019ll get back
    up, {0} quickly steps over its body and rushes out the door."
  luckyPassText: '{0} steers well clear of the child, heading straight for the door
    instead. As they get closer however, the child-creature screams in rage, and
    scampers across the ground on all fours, straight at them. As {0} starts to run,
    they trip over a loose shoelace lace and fall flat on their face. The child stops
    at once, giggling, and then laughing at the sight. {0} chuckles nervously as
    they get up, and then rush straight out of the door.'

    pain, but as soon as they do,  the child stops, giggling, and then laughing.
    \u201CYou scream funny,\u201D it says. {0} forces a nervous chuckle, and then
    limps straight out of the door."

    anything left of {0} anyway."
