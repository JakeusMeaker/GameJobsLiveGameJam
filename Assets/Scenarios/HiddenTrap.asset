  scenarioText: The room seems perfectly empty, with bare walls and old wooden floorboards.
    A moment of respite, perhaps.
  passTraitText: While a less keen eye may have overlooked it, {0} notices that one
    of the floorboards is faintly depressed immediately. They approach carefully,
    and step cleanly over it. Who knows, it may have been nothing, but {0} has a
    feeling that they just avoided something very bad.
  secondary1PassText: "It\u2019s hard to know if anything is truly wrong with this
    room, but {0} isn\u2019t taking any chances. If there were to be a trap, it would
    surely be hidden in the floorboards or towards the center of the room where people
    are most likely to pass through. As such {0} instead presses themself close to
    the wall and makes their way through without a problem."
  secondary2PassText: Ever light of foot, {0} leads the way. About halfway across
    the room, they freeze mid-step perfectly still, before slowly lifting their foot
    back up. The floorboard they had started to put their weight on lifts up, ever
    so slightly. A trap! Anyone with a heavier footfall would have stood no chance.
    Crisis averted. {0} steps cleanly over the floorboard, and continues to the door.
  luckyPassText: "{0} makes it halfway across the room when suddenly, a floorboard
    gives beneath their foot. They trip and fall forward, but it\u2019s fortunate
    they did! A heavy rusted axe blade swings down from the shadows of the ceiling,
    cleaving through the space where {0} was a moment before. That was a very close
    call..."
  failText: '{0} makes it halfway across the room when suddenly, a floorboard gives
    beneath their foot. As it does, a heavy rusted axe blade swings down from the
    shadows of the ceiling. {0} dives forward out of the way, but the blade cleaves
    deep into their shoulder, splattering a trail of red across the floorboards as
    it swings back up into place.'
  characterCriticalFail: '{0} makes it halfway across the room when suddenly, a floorboard
    gives beneath their foot. As it does, a heavy rusted axe blade swings down from
    the shadows of the ceiling. The startled {0} has but a moment to look up before
    it cleaves cleanly through their neck, leaving their head rolling across the
    floorboards as their body crumples. The axe clanks back into place in the ceiling,
    leaving the room in chilling silence. A trail of blood now paints where not to
    step.
