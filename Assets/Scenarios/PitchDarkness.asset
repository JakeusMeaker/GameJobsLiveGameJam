  scenarioText: 'The room is pitch black. There is no visible door, or walls, or
    even floor. There could be absolutely anything in here. '
  passTraitText: '{0} peers into the room. Where ordinary eyes see only impenetrable
    darkness {0} can seem to be able to make out imperceptible details. They inch
    forward, following moving carefully through until they find the other side. They
    find a light switch on the wall by the door, but turning it on reveals a room
    only a few meters across. How strange...'
  secondary1PassText: "Though {0} can see nothing in the room, their rational mind
    formulates a plan. They pry a tiny crack in the door to the last room as a fixed
    reference point, and then inch forward, using the fixed reference point behind
    them to ensure they\u2019re going in a straight line. For some reason they have
    a bad feeling about following the walls around, but it pays off when they reach
    the other side. They find a light switch on the wall by the door, but turning
    it on reveals a room only a few meters across. How strange..."
  secondary2PassText: "Accustomed to working in the dark for reasons they tend not
    to divulge, {0} takes a small stick from their pack and begins sweeping the ground
    in front of them as they move forward. They almost get turned around at times,
    but seem to have an uncanny knack for moving around in the dark, so it\u2019s
    not long before they reach the other side. They find a light switch on the wall
    by the door, but turning it on reveals a room only a few meters across. How strange..."
  luckyPassText: "One tentative step at a time, {0} begins to walk into the darkness,
    arms outstretched. At first they feel as if they are making steady progress,
    but after what feels like an age of stumbling around, they find themselves utterly
    lost. As walking in one direction didn\u2019t seem to work, the only recourse
    now is to jog until they find a wall. The room must be huge as it takes a good
    minute of jogging before they reach a wall. Groping around on it, {0} finds a
    lightswitch, but when they turn it on it reveals a room only a few meters across.
    How strange\u2026 On the bright side, the exit door is right here."
  failText: "One tentative step at a time, {0} begins to walk into the darkness,
    arms outstretched. At first they feel as if they are making steady progress,
    but after what feels like an age of stumbling around, they find themselves utterly
    lost. Why can\u2019t they find a wall? {0} walks and walks. Hours pass. Days.
    Then suddenly\u2026 a wall. A lightswitch. They turn it on to reveal a room only
    a few meters across. But it\u2019s been so long. Hasn\u2019t it? The exit door
    is right there, but as {0} pulls themself through, exhausted, they can\u2019t
    help but feel like they lost years of their life, trapped in that room."

    darkness, arms outstretched. At first they feel as if they are making steady
    progress, but after what feels like an age of stumbling around, they find themselves
    utterly lost. Why can\u2019t they find a wall? {0} walks and walks until the
    darkness swallows them. Content with the offering, the lights in the room flicker
    on to reveal that it is only a few meters across, with the exit door right there.
    But {0} is nowhere to be seen."

    Eventually the darkness swallows them entirely. Perhaps they are walking still."
