  scenarioText: Upon entering the room, the spiked walls rumble into life, slowly
    inching towards each other. The exit door is a long way off!
  passTraitText: "{0} doesn\u2019t waste a single second, immediately breaking into
    a sprint. They make it to the end of the room with time to spare, hitting the
    button on the far wall to reset the spikes."
  secondary1PassText: Seeing the immediate danger, {0} runs for the far wall. Their
    excellent physical fitness carries them almost all the way to the end in time,
    where they find a spot without spikes  to heave against the walls for just long
    enough to kick the button on the far wall and reset the spikes.
  secondary2PassText: Seeing the immediate danger, {0} runs for the far wall. They
    get almost all the way to the end in time, where they find a spot without spikes
    to brace against the walls for just long enough to kick the button on the far
    wall and reset the spikes. A couple of minor cuts are nothing to {0}.
  luckyPassText: "Seeing the immediate danger, {0} runs for the far wall. They get
    most of the way to the end in time, but the walls are closing too fast, and they\u2019re
    about to run out of space. Suddenly, there is a horrible mechanical clanking
    sound, and the walls judder to a halt. Perhaps the mechanism broke? {0} hits
    the button on the far wall to reset the spikes, which fortunately works, allowing
    access to the exit door."
  failText: "Seeing the immediate danger {0} runs for the far wall. They get most
    of the way to the end in time, but the walls are closing too fast, and they\u2019re
    about to run out of space. They squeeze sideways as the spikes close in on them,
    and just manage to hit the button on the far wall with the tips of their fingers.
    The spike walls slide back into their original positions, but {0} has sustained
    a few nasty cuts."
  characterCriticalFail: "Seeing the immediate danger {0} runs for the far wall.
    They get most of the way to the end in time, squeezing sideways, but the walls
    are closing too fast, and the spikes are slicing into them as they press on.
    The walls meet and they are cut off from view. Suddenly, the spike walls slide
    back into their original positions, but {0}\u2019s lacerated body lies beneath
    the button, arm outstretched in a final selfless act.\r\n"
  partyCriticalFail: "Seeing the immediate danger {0} runs for the far wall. They
    barely get halfway before they realise they aren\u2019t going to make it, and
    turn back. But they\u2019re too far in now, and as the walls close, they seal
    {0} in, forming a final, bloody tomb around them."
