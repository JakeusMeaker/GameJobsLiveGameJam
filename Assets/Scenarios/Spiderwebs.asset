  scenarioText: "The room is full of thick, sticky cobwebs. There are tiny, almost
    imperceptible movements from within. The webs stretch from wall to wall, floor
    to ceiling. The only way onwards\u2026 is through."
  passTraitText: '{0} adopts a broad, sturdy pose and marches forwards. Webs stick
    to them, but they keep powering on. Even as tiny spiders begin to rush over their
    body, {0} seems unfazed, and every step comes right after the last until they
    reach the other side, leaving a clear trail of broken webs in their wake.'
  secondary1PassText: "{0} rubs their hands together and starts to push through the
    webs. Where they can, they slip through gaps, and where they can\u2019t, they
    tear the weaker areas of the web to progress. Tiny spiders begin to rush over
    their body, but {0} quickly brushes the worst of them off. Sure enough, before
    long they\u2019ve reached the other side, leaving a small path through in their
    wake."
  secondary2PassText: '{0} flexes their muscles, and rushes into the webs, arms a
    flurry as they tear through the webs. Tiny spiders begin to rush over their body
    but {0} slaps most of them away, tearing ahead until they reach the other side,
    leaving a clear trail of broken webs in their wak'
  luckyPassText: "{0} mumbles a few words of self encouragement and starts to push
    through the webs. The webs stick to them like glue as they go, tangling in their
    hair and catching their limbs. Before long, they are completely stuck. Tiny spiders
    begin to rush over the webs towards them, but {0} writhes like a wounded animal.
    Miraculously the webs break, dropping them to the ground where they frantically
    crawl forward. Sure enough, before long they\u2019ve reached the other side,
    leaving a small path through in their wake."
  failText: '{0} mumbles a few words of self encouragement and starts to push through
    the webs. The webs stick to them like glue as they go, tangling in their hair
    and catching their limbs. Before long, they are completely stuck. Tiny spiders
    begin to rush over their body, biting at their exposed flesh. They thrash about
    until the webs break, rushing through blindly but just make it to the other side,
    dripping spiders. A small path of trampled web lies in their wake.'

    Tiny spiders begin to rush over their body, biting at their exposed flesh. They
    call for help, but to no avail. The spiders rush over their face and into their
    mouth, stifling their cries, until all that remains is a wriggling black shape
    being dragged into the shadows. Fortunately, the way through is half dug already.
    Only one will fall victim to the spiders today.'
