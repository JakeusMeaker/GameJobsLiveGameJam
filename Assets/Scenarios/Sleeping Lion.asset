  scenarioText: "A huge lion lies sleeping on the smooth stone floor. Though it looks
    peaceful right now, its claws look sharper than knives. There\u2019s no chance
    anyone could fight this thing. How did it even get here?"
  passTraitText: "{0} paces forth, their feet seeming to almost glide across the
    ground, making no sound at all. The lion doesn\u2019t so much as bat an eyelid."
  secondary1PassText: "Instead of leaving the lion, {0} approaches it, crouching
    next to it as they begin to run their hand over its mane. The lion\u2019s eyes
    snap open, staring right at {0}, but it remains motionless. A strange rumbling
    sound emanates from the lion\u2026 Is it starting to purr? Instead of sticking
    around to find out {0} raises their hands and slowly backs towards the exit.
    The lion remains motionless, though its eyes do not leave {0}."
  secondary2PassText: "The lion could wake up any second, and {0} isn\u2019t sticking
    around to find out. With barely a moment\u2019s hesitation they dash for the
    door. The lion\u2019s eyes snap awake, completely focused on {0} as it pounces
    straight at them. But they are too fast! They duck and dive as the lion pounces
    at them over and over, making the beast look clumsy as they reach the exit completely
    unscathed."
  luckyPassText: "That lion could wake up, and {0} isn\u2019t sticking around to
    find out. After a quick glance at the lion, they dash for the door. The lion\u2019s
    eyes snap awake, completely focused on {0} as it pounces straight at them. But
    the lion\u2019s claw snags on the teddy bear where it was sleeping, tearing it
    wide open and spraying stuffing across the ground. The lion spins in mid air,
    roaring as it bounds back for the maimed bear. {0} doesn\u2019t waste any time
    in making an exit."
  failText: "The lion could wake up any second, and {0} isn\u2019t sticking around
    to find out. After a quick glance at the lion, they dash for the door. The lion\u2019s
    eyes snap awake, completely focused on {0} as it pounces towards them, razor
    claws fortunately only grazing their side. Somewhat bloodied, {0} makes a hasty
    exit, and the placated lion curls up and returns to sleep."
  characterCriticalFail: "The lion could wake up any second, and {0} isn\u2019t sticking
    around to find out. After a quick glance at the lion, they dash for the door.
    The lion\u2019s eyes snap awake, completely focused on {0} as it pounces towards
    them, razor claws slicing straight through their throat. Lifeless, {0} drops
    like a sack of bricks. The placated lion curls up around their prone form and
    returns to sleep. Recovering the body seems out of the question..."
  partyCriticalFail: "The lion could wake up any second, and {0} isn\u2019t sticking
    around to find out. After a quick glance at the lion, they dash for the door.
    The lion\u2019s eyes snap awake, completely focused on {0} as it pounces towards
    them, razor claws slicing straight through their throat. Lifeless, {0} drops
    like a sack of bricks. The lion curls up around their prone form and returns
    to sleep, content with its snack for later."
