  scenarioText: A gigantic bear stands in this room, physically blocking the only
    way through the room. An old wooden hand axe lies on the ground right in front
    of the door. Though it clutches a small stuffed lion, the bear stares down at
    the axe with cold, empty eyes. A fight is inevitable.
  passTraitText: "{0} picks up the axe with a deep breath, and charges the bear.
    The bear emits an ear-splitting roar, and lumbers towards them on two legs, swinging
    its huge paw. But the bear is slow and {0} acts with lethal intent, burying the
    axe to the haft in the bear\u2019s skull. The bear comes toppling down, its momentum
    carrying it forward as it tumbles to the ground."
  secondary1PassText: "{0} picks up the axe with a deep breath, and edges towards
    the bear. The bear emits an ear-splitting roar, and lumbers towards them on two
    legs, swinging its huge paw. But the bear is slow. {0} braces, trying to put
    the blade of the axe in the way of the bear\u2019s paws instead of using it as
    an offensive weapon. Every time the bear attacks, it cuts its own paws on the
    axe, until it rears back in agony, and {0} presses forward to deliver the coup
    de gr\xE2ce. The bear tumbles to the ground, dead at last."
  secondary2PassText: "{0} picks up the axe with a determined breath, and edges towards
    the bear. The bear emits an ear-splitting roar, and {0} roars back like a lion.
    The bear turns it\u2019s head in momentary confusion, and it\u2019s all the opportunity
    {0} needs. They strike forward with a fury born of desperation, striking again
    and again at the bear\u2019s face. The bear tries to back away, protecting its
    face with its huge paws, but {0} is unrelenting. With one final strike, they
    plunge the axe into the bear\u2019s chest and it tumbles to the ground, dead
    at last.\r\n"

    {0} swings the axe at the bear, but it catches the stuffed lion instead, tearing
    it from the bear\u2019s grasp. The bear howls with dismay, eyes fixed on the
    lion embedded on the axe, In response {0} throws the axe, into the corner of
    the room, and the bear immediately rushes to its aid. {0} spares no time in hopping
    over the bars and escaping."

    The bear emits an ear-splitting roar, and lumbers towards them on two legs. {0}
    swings the axe at the bear, sticking it in the bear\u2019s chest with little
    noticeable effect. In response, the bear bats {0} with its paw, sending them
    hurtling into a wall. The bear then retreats to the corner of the room, where
    it tries to pluck out the axe with its clumsy paws. Injured, {0} still wastes
    no time in pulling themself to their feet, and escaping through the bars"
