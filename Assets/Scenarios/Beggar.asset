  scenarioText: "There is a slumped figure in the center of the room, face and body
    obscured by a large cloak and robes. \u201CDo you have something for me?\u201D
    he calls out. Perhaps he is simply a beggar... But what kind of beggar would
    be in this place?"
  passTraitText: '{0} cautiously approaches, kneeling next to the figure and opening
    their pack. They explain they have no coins but can share their lunch with him,
    offering him a hearty sandwich wrapped in brown paper. The figure eagerly accepts,
    taking a large bite. He gestures at the door with the sandwich, which swings
    magically open.'
  secondary1PassText: "{0} cautiously approaches, sitting next to the figure. They
    explain that the only thing that they could possibly give him would be the clothes
    off their own back. They too are going through their own time of hardship, all
    they can offer is a little empathy. The figure considers this for a moment, before
    slowly raising his hand towards the door, which magically swings open. \u201CBe
    on your way then.\u201D"
  secondary2PassText: Better to not take any chances {0} cautiously approaches, watching
    for sudden movements. They crouch next to the figure, barely hesitating before
    they whip out a knife and thrust it straight into the figure, who does absolutely
    nothing to resist. As the knife enters, the robes fold away around it, falling
    into a pile on the floor, and revealing no body at all. {0} is nonetheless relieved
    when they cross the room and pull the door open with ease.
  luckyPassText: "{0} stares suspiciously at the figure for a moment, trying to determine
    any ill intent, before digging through their pockets for some coins to give the
    figure. After some rummaging around, they find a single gold coin. How did that
    get there? {0} places it on the floor before the figure, who lifts his arm towards
    the door. \u201CFate has been kind to you.\u201D he says, and the door swings
    magically open."
  failText: "{0} stares suspiciously at the figure for a moment, trying to determine
    any ill intent, before digging through their pockets for some coins to give the
    figure. After some moments rummaging around, they find absolutely nothing. \u201CThen
    I will choose something.\u201D says the figure, raising his hand towards {0}.
    Nothing happens, but they begin to feel strangely hollow, as if something very
    important was taken from them. The figure then lifts his arm towards the door,
    which swings magically open."
  characterCriticalFail: "{0} stares suspiciously at the figure for a moment, trying
    to determine any ill intent, before digging through their pockets for some coins
    to give the figure. After some moments rummaging around, they find absolutely
    nothing. \u201CThen you will give me your time instead.\u201D says the figure,
    placing both of his hands together. In a puff of smoke, {0} instantly disappears,
    leaving behind nothing but a pile of clothes. The figure then lifts his arm towards
    the door, which swings magically open, and speaks in a younger man\u2019s voice,
    \u201CBe on your way.\u201D"
  partyCriticalFail: "{0} stares suspiciously at the figure for a moment, trying

    nothing. \u201CThere is but one thing left to give\u201D says the figure, placing
    both of his hands together. In a puff of smoke, {0} instantly disappears, leaving
    behind nothing but a pile of clothes. "
