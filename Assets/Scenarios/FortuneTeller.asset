  scenarioText: "This room feels... Unusual. The smell of incense hangs in the air,
    and a strange woman sits, gazing into a swirling sphere. She speaks softly. \u201CFate
    brought you to me. Where will it take you next?\u201D "
  passTraitText: "{0} sits before the woman and waits. She gazes into the orb for
    what feels like an age, before staring at them, one eye gleaming through the
    shadows to meet theirs. Her voice is barely more than a whisper, but betrays
    a burning hatred. \u201CYou are not like the others. Fortune has always favoured
    you. Here it will betray you as oft as not. But I cannot harm your kind even
    if I wished to.\u201D  She snaps her fingers and the curtains part, revealing
    the door behind them."

    there is no virtue greater than determination. I cannot predict your future,
    but you will have safe passage through my domain today.\u201D  She snaps her
    fingers and the curtains part, revealing the door behind them."

  failText: "{0} sits before the woman and waits. She gazes into the orb for what
    feels like an age, before staring at them, one eye gleaming through the shadows
    to meet theirs. Her voice is barely more than a whisper, but seems a little melancholy.
    \u201CFate does not smile upon you. You may escape, if only...\u201D  She sighs.
    \u201CPerhaps I could\u2026 But no.\u201D She snaps her fingers and the curtains
    part, revealing the door behind them. As {0} leaves they feel a sudden oppressive
    weight upon them, as if the whole universe were conspiring against them. The
    feeling passes, but they are shaken and pale."

    a great sadness. \u201CIf you wish to survive, you can go no further.\u201D She
    sighs. \u201CYour death waits just ahead. Perhaps you would stay here, rather
    than face it?\u201D {0} reluctantly agrees to stay behind. Maybe they can find
    another way out of this mess."

    how to spurn fate. Perhaps one day we can escape together.\u201D Almost relieved,
    {0} agrees to stay. Given the circumstances, things could have gone much worse."
