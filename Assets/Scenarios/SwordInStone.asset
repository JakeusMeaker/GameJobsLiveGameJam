  scenarioText: "In the center of the room there is a sword protruding from a rock.
    It glimmers with a pale red light. An inscription on the stone reads, \u2018Only
    the Worthy.\u2019 There is no door in sight."
  passTraitText: "'Only the Worthy\u2019. {0} isn\u2019t sure if that means them,
    but never one to be discouraged they step forward, placing their hand on the
    hilt and pulling. A voice emanates through the room. \u201CWorthy!\u201D The
    sword slides out of the rock with ease, glowing until it is blindingly bright.
    {0} averts their eyes, when all of a sudden, the sword disappears. But a door
    seems to have materialised in the back wall."

    on the hilt and pulling. A voice emanates through the room. \u201CHmm. Worthy!\u201D
    The sword is still for a moment, then slides out of the rock, glowing until it
    is blindingly bright. {0} averts their eyes, when all of a sudden, the sword

    they\u2019ve gotta be the most worthy. Who else could pull a sword out of a rock?
    They brace themselves on the rock, both hands on the hilt\u2026 And pull.  A
    voice emanates through the room. \u201CUnworthy!\u201D The sword stays firmly
    in place as {0} tugs and heaves, face beet red. Then there is a crack, and a
    shudder, and the sword shatters out of the rock, scattering fragments of it across
    the room. The voice booms out again. \u201CUgh. Fine. Worthy!\u201D The sword
    glows an angry red, growing in intensity until it is blindingly bright. {0} averts
    their eyes, when all of a sudden, the sword disappears. But a door seems to have
    materialised in the back wall."

    bright. The voice booms out again. \u201CDamn it. It\u2019s supposed to be stuck.\u201D

    fire, forcing them to quickly pat away the flames. The voice booms out again.
    \u201CLeave this place!\u201D A door seems to have materialised in the back wall,
