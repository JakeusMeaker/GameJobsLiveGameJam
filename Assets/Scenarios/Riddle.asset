  scenarioText: "There is no door on the far wall, only an animated face cut into
    the stonework. It grins, seemingly pleased to have company. \u201CAnswer me these
    questions three...\u201D It says with a sly wink."
  passTraitText: "{0} eagerly listens to the questions. The first two are easy, and
    while the third seems to be making an unexpected reference, it is but a trifle
    for {0}\u2019s dazzling intellect. Satisfied, the face grins once more, opening
    its mouth wider and wider until it reveals the way forward."
  secondary1PassText: "{0} reluctantly listens to the questions. The first two are
    easy, but the third is the kind of thing no one could possibly know. {0} seems
    baffled, and asks for the face to clarify some of the details. After some back
    and forth, the face reveals it has no idea what the answer to the riddle is either,
    but has been satisfied by {0}\u2019s penchant for pop culture references. The
    face grins once more, opening its mouth wider and wider until it reveals the
    way forward."
  secondary2PassText: '{0} listens to the questions, but seems a little distracted.
    The first two are easy, but halfway through the third, {0} dashes straight towards
    the startled face, reaching into its mouth, and pushing a well concealed button.
    The face begins cursing {0}, but can only get out a few words before its mouth
    is forced open, revealing the way forward. It glares at {0} as they climb through.'
  luckyPassText: '{0} listens to the questions. The first two are easy, but the third
    is the kind of thing no one could possibly know. The face twists into a smug
    leer, but {0} shrugs and answers, taking a shot in the dark. The face is speechless
    for a moment, before confirming that this was indeed the correct answer. Satisfied,
    the face grins once more, opening its mouth wider and wider until it reveals
    the way forward.'
  failText: "{0} listens to the questions. The first two are easy, but the third
    is the kind of thing no one could possibly know. The face twists into a smug
    leer, relishing its inevitable victory. Sure enough, {0} cannot answer. \u201CJust
    a little taste this time.\u201Dsays the face, and a long stoney tongue lashes
    out of its mouth, and around {0}. It constricts them for a moment, crushing them
    in its grasp. \u201CDelicious\u201D, it says as it coils its tongue back into
    its mouth, releasing them. Seemingly satisfied, the face grins once more, opening
    its mouth wider and wider until it reveals the way forward."
  characterCriticalFail: "{0} listens to the questions. The first two are easy, but
    the third is the kind of thing no one could possibly know. The face twists into
    a smug leer, relishing its inevitable victory. Sure enough, {0} cannot answer.
    \u201CJust one bite\u201D says the face, and a long stoney tongue lashes towards
    {0}, pulling them into its mouth. There is a moment as the face seems to chew
    and consider. Seemingly satisfied, the face grins once more. \u201CI never can
    help myself\u201D, it says,  opening its mouth wider and wider until it reveals
    the way forward, but no sign of {0} at all."
  partyCriticalFail: "{0} listens to the questions. The first two are easy, but the
    third is the kind of thing no one could possibly know. The face twists into a
    smug leer, relishing its inevitable victory. Sure enough, {0} cannot answer.
    \u201CPerhaps a nibble\u201D says the face, and a long stoney tongue lashes towards
    {0}, pulling them into its mouth. The face seems to chew and consider for a few
    minutes, until blood begins to trickle down it\u2019s chin. \u201COops.\u201D"
