  scenarioText: A curious spirit immediately floats forward, demanding attention.
    It seems fascinated by life.
  passTraitText: '{0} calmly explains that you need to pass through the room. The
    spirit seems disappointed, but floats lazily away, letting them pass.'
  secondary1PassText: "{0} walks up to the spirit and stares right back at it. It
    doesn\u2019t seem discouraged, and it phases into their body, but {0} remains
    unmoved, taking deep breaths, and keeping their gaze focused. After a moment
    the spirit seems bored, and floats lazily away."
  secondary2PassText: "{0} pulls a sandwich from their bag, offering it to the delighted
    spirit. It phases into the sandwich, which dances out of {0}\u2019s hand and
    floats around the room. They decide they had best move on while the spirit is
    distracted."
  luckyPassText: "{0} cautiously approaches the spirit, which promptly phases into
    their body. {0}\u2019s eyes begin to roll back in their head, but then they shake
    their head, as if coming to their senses. The spirit does not reappear, but {0}
    seems to be eager to continue, with renewed enthusiasm."
  failText: "{0} frustratedly shoos away the spirit which promptly glides towards
    them phasing into their body. {0}\u2019s eyes roll up into their head, and their
    limbs bend at strange angles as they take a few shambling steps. After a few
    moments the spirit seems bored and floats away, leaving poor {0} to limp to the
    door."
  characterCriticalFail: "{0} frustratedly shoos away the spirit which promptly glides
    towards them phasing into their body. {0}\u2019s eyes roll up into their head,
    and their limbs bend at strange angles, cracking and contorting beyond what should
    be possible. Their lips twist and a voice both familiar and strange emanates
    from their mouth. \u201CThis is mine now.\u201D It seems {0} will have to be
    left behind. "
