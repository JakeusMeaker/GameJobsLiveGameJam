  scenarioText: "You are lost within this haunted place. \nTo escape, you must rely
    on the people around you. \nYou will be presented with challenges - choose the
    correct trait to pass unscathed.\nThere is a perfect skill for each situation.
    There are also two skills that give you a chance to pass unharmed. Luck is a
    fickle mistress, but often better than a shot in the dark.\nChoosing the right
    skill will cost you stamina.\nChoosing the wrong skill, or failing a secondary
    skill, will cost you health as well as stamina.\nIf you have no stamina, you
    can use health. Beware, this makes failures twice as dangerous.\n\nPress Space
    to skip text typing, and click \"Move On\" to move to the next scenario. Good
    luck!"
