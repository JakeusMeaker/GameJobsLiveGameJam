  scenarioText: "A heavy, glittering jewel rests on a central pedestal. The door
    has a space that looks to fit the jewel exactly. It\u2019s obvious that the pedestal
    must be trapped in some way, but less obvious how.\r\n"
  passTraitText: "{0} cracks their knuckles. They always thought that Indiana Jones
    sucked at this. They eye up the jewel, sliding a pencil case out of their backpack,
    and removing some of the stationary until they think the weights match. Then
    slowly, oh so slowly, they slide the jewel off, as they slide the case on. Perfect!
    {0}\u2019s sleight of hand knows no equal. The jewel slides into the slot in
    the door, which creaks open."
  secondary1PassText: "If there\u2019s a trap, it can be found, and if it can be
    found, {0} can find it. They peer around the room, until they notice tiny holes
    in one of the walls adjacent to the pedestal. It looks like something might shoot
    out of them. {0} crouches down behind the opposite side of the pedestal, obscuring
    as much of their body as they can, and takes the jewel. Sure enough, darts whizz
    across the room, skimming past {0}, but they emerge from behind the pedestal
    unscathed. The jewel slides into the slot in the door, which creaks open."
  secondary2PassText: Even if there is a trap, {0} is sure they can be out of the
    way in time. They take a running start, grabbing the jewel as they rush past
    the pedestal. Darts fly out of tiny holes in one of the walls, but {0} drops
    into a slide and skids out of the way just in time. The jewel slides into the
    slot in the door, which creaks open.
  luckyPassText: '{0} decides their best bet is to snatch the jewel, and then get
    through the door as fast as they can. As they grab the jewel, darts immediately
    fly out of one of the walls. {0} freezes in shock, but miraculously, all of the
    darts missed, embedding themselves in the wall behind {0} instead. {0} smiles
    at their fortitude, and the stolen jewel slides neatly into the slot in the door,
    which creaks open.'
  failText: '{0} decides their best bet is to snatch the jewel, and then get through
    the door as fast as they can. As they grab the jewel, darts immediately fly out
    of one of the walls. {0} tries to dive out of the way, but is peppered by a couple
    of the darts. They quickly pull them out, dripping with an acrid green liquid,
    and totter to the door, feeling markedly weaker than before. The jewel slides
    neatly into the slot, and the door creaks open.'

    immediately fly out of one of the walls. {0} tries to dive out of the way, but
    is peppered by several darts. They begin pulling them out, noticing the acrid
    green liquid they drip with, but feel weaker by the second. Before they can pull
    out more than a couple, they collapse against the wall, eyes glazing over, stone
    dead. It\u2019s over for {0}, but the jewel they retrieved slides into the slot
    in the door, which creaks open."
