  scenarioText: The exit is blocked by a writhing, formless mass of eyes, the stuff
    of pure nightmare. Upon drawing closer, it fills the mind with visions of their
    darkest fears.
  passTraitText: "{0} steps forward and their knees begin to buckle, but they remain
    standing. Their eyes are narrowed, and remain clear and present. The mass\u2019
    own many eyes are wild. Some look confused, others angry. Eventually it seems
    to let out a puff of air, as if sighing, and fades rapidly into nothingness.
    {0} smiles in satisfaction, striding confidently to the door."
  secondary1PassText: "{0} steps forward and falls to their knees, teeth gritted.
    Their eyes are wide and unseeing, and they let out a pained groan, as they begin
    to shake and shudder. But then, the mass too begins to shake, it\u2019s own many
    eyes wide and panicked. All of a sudden, there is a loud pop as the mass bursts
    outward, rapidly fading to nothing in the air. {0} stands slowly and nods. They\u2019re
    okay. It\u2019s over."
  secondary2PassText: "{0} steps forward and falls to their knees, hands clasped
    over their mouth. Their eyes are wide and unseeing, tears stream down their cheeks
    as they shake softly... Then, the mass begins to fade, it\u2019s many eyes closing
    as it\u2019s body crumbles to fine dust. {0} stands slowly and lets out a breath,
    a sad smile on their face. It\u2019s over."
  luckyPassText: "{0} steps forward and falls to their knees, breathing heavily.
    Their eyes are wide and unseeing, mouth open wide as they begin to\u2026 laugh?
    A little at first, but soon they are guffawing, tears rolling down their cheeks. 
    The mass\u2019 many eyes at first look confused, and then a little embarrassed.
    All of a sudden, all of it\u2019s many eyes roll in unison and it rapidly fades
    to nothing in the air. {0} stands slowly and wipes a tear from their eye, grinning.
    Perhaps the creature made some kind of mistake."
  failText: "{0} steps forward and falls to their knees, breathing heavily. Their
    eyes are wide and unseeing, mouth open wide as they begin to scream, shudder
    and shake. Their hands wave frantically, as if fending off an invisible enemy,
    but there can be no defence against their own mind. The mass\u2019 many eyes
    narrow, and then the whole being begins to fade into nothingness. {0} takes a
    minute to come to their senses, shakily getting to their feet, their face deathly
    pale. It\u2019s over, but the creature took its toll."

    Their eyes are wide and unseeing, mouth open wide as they begin to scream, shudder

    narrow, and then the whole being begins to fade into nothingness. Several minutes
    pass but {0} does not come to their senses. They remain kneeling in the center
    of the room, shaking and muttering something under their breath. They will have
    to be left behind. "

    open wide in satisfaction, and it surges forward, growing until it fills the
    whole room. It gradually envelops {0}, muffling their desperate screams and then...
    Snuffing them out entirely."
