  scenarioText: " A crooked figure stands bent over a cauldron. She moves in sudden,
    crooked motions and beckons, speaking with a voice like the caw of a crow. \u201CIt\u2019s
    been a while since I had any visitors. Come and talk with me, you can help prepare
    a potion and then I\u2019ll let you pass.\u2019"
  passTraitText: '{0} seems fascinated by the potion brewing in the cauldron, and
    eagerly listens to the witch explain her instructions. With a natural talent
    for learning, they help the witch measure and prepare ingredients and show great
    aptitude for the craft. The witch seems very pleased for the assistance and company,
    happily sending {0} on their way once the potion is prepared.'
  secondary1PassText: '{0} eyes the cauldron curiously, and carefully listens to
    the witch explain her instructions. Though the craft does not come easily to
    them, they remember the instructions she gave them to the letter, and recognise
    ingredients with ease. The witch seems quite pleased for the assistance and company,
    cackling and sending {0} on their way once the potion is prepared.'
  secondary2PassText: "{0} eyes the cauldron with trepidation, doing their best to
    listen to the witch explain her instructions. The process is baffling to {0},
    and they make mistake after mistake, but all the while, they chat animatedly
    away with the witch, who seems quite charmed by their company. \u201CThis potion
    is awful.\u201D she says, when they are done. \u201CBut I can always make another.
    Thank you for making this old woman laugh.\u201D"

    potion should be awful.\u201D she says, when they are done. \u201CBut somehow,
    it\u2019s come out just right. Perhaps you are better at this than I am.\u201D
    She eyes {0} suspiciously, then lets them leave."

    mess.\u201D She flicks her finger, making a jet of potion erupt from the cauldron,
    and fly straight up {0}\u2019s nose and mouth. They splutter, and almost immediately
    their skin turns a sickly shade of green. \u201CBe off with you!\u201D she says,
    and {0} staggers away, feeling as ill as they look."
