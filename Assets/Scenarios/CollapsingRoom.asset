  scenarioText: The beams in this room creak under the weight of what appears to
    be rocks above them. No sooner is the door to the room opened than it all starts
    to collapse, beginning to fill the room and block the way through!
  passTraitText: "Perfect Pass: {0} surges forward and pushes the fallen rocks aside
    with remarkable ease. A particularly large one blocks the exit, but it is no
    match for {0}\u2019s herculean strength, and they shove it out of the way, leaving
    the exit door open before too many rocks have fallen at all."
  secondary1PassText: '{0} is a colossus. The falling rocks seem no more bother to
    them than rain, allowing for a relatively easy path through. A particularly large
    rock blocks the exit, which they heave out of the way long enough to allow a
    dash for the door, and {0} is left with only minor bruises.'
  secondary2PassText: '{0} sees an opening and goes for it. Ducking and diving through
    the falling rocks, they slip through a gap in the rubble blocking the exit door,
    and immediately the chaos behind them ceases. The rocks have stopped falling.
    Perhaps it was some mechanism causing the collapse? How strange.'
  luckyPassText: '{0} runs through as rocks fall around them, miraculously missing
    them by inches and leaving a straight path to the door largely unobstructed A
    particularly large rock blocks the exit, which they heave out of the way with
    difficulty, long enough to allow a dash for the door.'
  failText: '{0} runs through as rocks fall, battering them as they go but leaving
    a straight path to the door largely unobstructed A particularly large rock blocks
    the exit, which they heave out of the way with difficulty, long enough to allow
    a dash for the door. Finally, they push through and escape, bloodied but alive.'
  characterCriticalFail: '{0} runs through as rocks fall, battering them as they
    go but leaving a straight path to the door largely unobstructed A particularly
    large rock blocks the exit, which they heave out of the way with difficulty,
    holding it as to allow a dash for the door. But with no one after them to hold
    the rock, they are too slow. Mere inches from escape, a huge rock falls from
    the ceiling, filling the space where {0} was moments before. The only thing left
    to do is try to let their sacrifice not be in vain.'
  partyCriticalFail: "{0} runs through as rocks fall, battering them as they go.
    They press onwards, but it seems every step forward is thwarted by stone blocking
    their path. They twist and turn, and the exit door is in sight, when in a sudden
    flurry\u2026 The space where {0) was is swallowed by rubble. And there is only
    darkness."
