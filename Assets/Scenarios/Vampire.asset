  scenarioText: "A flamboyantly dressed man floats in the center of the room. His
    eyes snap open, and he extends his hand in welcome. He speaks in a smooth, accented
    voice. \u201CI want to suck your blood\u2026 No really. I\u2019m parched. You
    must have some to spare?\u201D "

    can lose some more and keep going with no trouble. The vampire eagerly sinks
    his teeth into their exposed neck, and drinks deeply. After a little while, {0}
    coughs politely, and the vampire pulls away. \u201CApologies. You have such a

    price to pay. The vampire eagerly sinks his teeth into their exposed neck, and
    drinks deeply. After a few moments, {0} shoves the vampire off, who pulls away.
    \u201CApologies. You have such a zesty, exciting flavour,\u201D he says, a little

    vial of blood. When did they collect that? The vampire sighs as he sees it. \u201CThe
    bottled stuff is never as good. But it will suffice.\u201D He takes it, and drinks
    deeply. \u201CApologies, I should be more grateful,\u201D he says, a little embarrassed.

    blood all over his immaculate clothes. \u201CApologies. Your flavour must be\u2026
    An acquired taste,\u201D he says, clearly embarrassed as he dabs at the blood
    on his shirt with a handkerchief. \u201CNow please, don\u2019t let me keep you.\u201D"
